## 💬 ENGAGEMENT TALKING POINTS

### When People Ask...

**"Why Maaza?"**
> Named after a popular Indian mango drink - sweet, refreshing, and accessible. Like our models: small, efficient, and easy to use.

**"Is 158 test cases enough?"**
> Yes for v1.0 - comparable to HumanEval (164 cases). We're expanding to 300+ in v1.1 based on community feedback. Being transparent about limitations.

**"Why synthetic data?"**
> Scalable, controlled, privacy-friendly. We validate quality (100% mathematical consistency). Real-world data coming in future versions.

**"MLM vs SLM - what's the difference?"**
> MLMs (10M-250M): Ultra-specialized, CPU-only, fast inference
> SLMs (250M-1.5B): Broader capabilities, still task-focused
> NLMs (<10MB): Future - ultra-specialized, embedded devices

**"Can I use this commercially?"**
> Yes! Apache 2.0 license - free for commercial use. No restrictions.

**"What hardware do I need?"**
> MLM-135M: Raspberry Pi 5, browser, any laptop CPU
> SLM-360M: Laptop CPU, server (no GPU required)
> Both run on CPU-only!

## 🎓 VALIDATION

### GPT Feedback (External Review)
> "These look *fantastic*. You've basically shipped:
> a mini research artifact + a production-ready edge model + a benchmark,
> all in two HF repos."

**Key Points**:
- ✅ Reproducible (researchers can replicate)
- ✅ Drop-in ready (devs can use immediately)
- ✅ Scaling story baked in (135M → 360M progression)
- ✅ Research + product balance
